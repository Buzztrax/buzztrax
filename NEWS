0.5.0 crown of thorns (06.Sep.2009)

Rewrite of internal pipeline management. One can now play partially connected
songs, and add/remove plugins while playing. Buzztard can play notes while
editing. More robust saving of songs. Lots of bugfixes and UI improvements.
Better user-guide including three small tutorials. Initial support for python
and javascript via gobject introspection.

0.4.0 the light in your eyes (26.Nov.2008)
================================================================================
As planned, main focus for this release was the wavetable support. Its done -
buzztard can load what gstreamer can decode. The wavetable view has a nice
waveform widget. Related to that buzztard has a new song-format that bundles the
XML together with external files in a zip archive. 
Also the UI has seen a lot of improvements. The machine view looks nicer - Marc
drew spiffy machine icons. In addition they now show real volume meters when
playing. All meters are now properly synced.

Lots of bugfixes, mostly memory leak and reference counting fixes. A few
improvements on the new pattern editor widget (added native scrolling and column
headers).

Improvements in all areas. We now have native buzzmachine support and better
compatibility. The buzztard editor got an own pattern editor widget. The ui got
lots of keyboard commands. We have settings for default directories used. The ui
has dialogs for recording mix-downs and also single tracks.

apply settings and introduces some interactivity features (interaction
controller and upnp playback controller).

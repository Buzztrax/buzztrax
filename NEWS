0.9.0 ascension (13.Jun.2015)
================================================================================
In this cycle we did a lot of finetuning on the gtk+3 port. More deprecated APIs
are replaced with the new API. We did a lot of work on theming; e.g. all colors
are now defined in the css files and settings let you select theme variants such
as a dark theme.
The interaction controller library now supports alsa-sequencer. The UI for
training the controls of a new midi device is streamlined and much easier. Also
the controls from the interaction controller can be used fro playback controls
(play/pause/seeking).
Finally things got easier for developers too. We merged bml, gst-buzztrax into
buzztrax to simplify the build.

0.8.0 bladerunner (24.Oct.2014)
================================================================================
This release port the code base to the recent version of the libraries we're
using. We switched from gstreamer-0.10 to 1.2, from gtk+-2.x to gtk+3.x, from
gconf to gsettings and replaced gnomecanvas by clutter. We've stared to make use
of the new features in some places (e.g. exporting labels in rendered songs).

0.7.0 victory, not vengeance (19.Jan.2013)
================================================================================
This release comes with a large number of smaller changes. Audio settings are more
flexible and allow to choose a target latency. Jack users will be happy to see that
we keep the session alive. We rewrote our test suite, fixed lots of bugs and
refactored a large part of the code base. This summer we had a GSoC student, who
implemented GStreamer EncodeBin support, which improves the song rendering code,
wrote a audio-synth baseclass that greatly simplifies writing a new synth and wrote
the pattern control source that allowed us to remove a lot of complicated code from
the sequencer core.
The gst-buzztrax module got more modular. There are a few new plugins (sidsyn, 
wave-replay and wavetabsyn).
We changed all modules to use non recursive make and we merged bsl into buzztrax to
make development easier.

0.6.0 black beats blue (25.Dec.2011)
================================================================================
Main feature of this release is full undo/redo support. Related to it is the
journaling of edit action and the crash recovery. This way chances of losing
changes in the song are quite low. Other UI improvements are: tip of day,
improved spectrum analyzer, clipboard support, more commands in context menus
and many more). This release features a gstreamer decoder that enables playback
of buzztrax songs in any gstreamer based media player.
We also kept the buzztrax codebase clean and ported from deprecated APIs to the
successors (gnomevfs->gio, hal->gudev). The libraries and the applications got
performance improvements in many areas.
Also the docs have been improved a lot with tutorials, keyboard shortcut tables,
better coverage and man-pages.

0.5.0 crown of thorns (06.Sep.2009)
================================================================================
Rewrite of internal pipeline management. One can now play partially connected
songs, and add/remove plugins while playing. Buzztrax can play notes while
editing. More robust saving of songs. Lots of bugfixes and UI improvements.
Better user-guide including three small tutorials. Initial support for python
and javascript via gobject introspection.

0.4.0 the light in your eyes (26.Nov.2008)
================================================================================
As planned, main focus for this release was the wavetable support. Its done -
buzztrax can load what gstreamer can decode. The wavetable view has a nice
waveform widget. Related to that buzztrax has a new song-format that bundles the
XML together with external files in a zip archive. 
Also the UI has seen a lot of improvements. The machine view looks nicer - Marc
drew spiffy machine icons. In addition they now show real volume meters when
playing. All meters are now properly synced.

0.3.1 after the ice (12.Apr.2008)
================================================================================
Lots of bugfixes, mostly memory leak and reference counting fixes. A few
improvements on the new pattern editor widget (added native scrolling and column
headers).

0.3.0 a tale of ice and darkness (26.Mar.2008)
================================================================================
Improvements in all areas. We now have native buzzmachine support and better
compatibility. The buzztrax editor got an own pattern editor widget. The ui got
lots of keyboard commands. We have settings for default directories used. The ui
has dialogs for recording mix-downs and also single tracks.

0.2.0 sunrise release (03.May.2007)
================================================================================
This version has lots of UI usability improvements, bug fixes, more instant
apply settings and introduces some interactivity features (interaction
controller and upnp playback controller).

0.1.0 genesis release (30.Oct.2006)
================================================================================
This is a technical preview version. The application is not complete or end-user
ready yet. The fileformat of the songs can still change.

Nonetheless if you find bugs or have comments, please take your time to contact
us.

run 'make todo' to get a list of todo comments from source

* next tasks
  * get a list of GstElements from GStreamer registry that are
    audio-outputs
    audio-generators (and implement the instrument interface)
    audio-effects
  * bt-edit
    * have a ui_ressource singleton
		  GdkColors
			GdkPixbuf, GtkImage

* how do we implement multiple voices per machine?
  * simulate
    * source 
      * separate instances that are mixed together
    * processors (e.g. multi-tap delay)
      * separate instances that are getting the same input
        and that are mixed together in the end
  * natively
    * instrument interface

* how do we handle global/voice-params
  * gstreamer does not support differentiation between them
  * therefore global_data is 0 for now
  * changes in gstreamer
    * dparam_manager needs to maintain several lists
      (one global and one for each voice)
    * gst-elemnts need caps to tell wheter they support multiple voices
    * if they do they need function to add/remove voices

* gobject private members
  * we need guidelines for use of ->priv, 
    when make members private, when public
  * we need some convention how to shorten all the
    object->priv->member statements
    * do once object_p=object->priv;
    * #define G_SELF self->priv

* new tests
  * load songs and lookup the parts
    (e.g. bt_machine_get_pattern_by_id)
	* try gtk_main_do_event() in GUI tests

* code enhancement
  * use G_CONST_RETURN

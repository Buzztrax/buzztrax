* run 'make todo' to get a list of todo comments from source

* next tasks
  * get a list of GstElements from GStremaer registry that are
    audio-outputs
    audio-generators (and implement the instrument interface)
    audio-effects

* how do we implement multiple voices per machine?
  * source 
    * separate instances that are mixed together
  * processors (e.g. multi-tap delay)
    * separate instances that are getting the same input
      and that are mixed together in the end

* how do we handle global/voice-params
  * gstreamer does not support differentiation between them
  * therefore global_data is 0 for now
  * changes in gstreamer
    * dparam_manager needs to maintain several lists
      (one global and one for each voice)
    * gst-elemnts need caps to tell wheter they support multiple voices
    * if they do they need function to add/remove voices

* gobject private members
  * we need guidelines for use of ->private, 
    when make members private, when public
  * we need some convention how to shorten all the
    object->private->member statements
    * do once object_p=object->private; ?

* split gtk-doc
  * into docs for: bt-core, bt-cmd bt-edit
  * this is neccesary that e.g. bt-mix can have a BT_MAIN_WINDOW class

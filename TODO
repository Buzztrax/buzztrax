run 'make todo' to get a list of todo comments from source

when releasing do:
  * make check
  * cd po;intltool-update -M
  * make dist

* next tasks
  * get a list of GstElements from GStreamer registry that are
    audio-outputs
    audio-generators (and implement the instrument interface)
    audio-effects
  * bt-edit
    * add volume-control to wire
      (look at volume popup from gnome-media)
    * sequence headings
      * add levvel-meter
      * add M/S/B Buttons

* how do we implement multiple voices per machine?
  * simulate
    * source 
      * separate instances that are mixed together
    * processors (e.g. multi-tap delay)
      * separate instances that are getting the same input
        and that are mixed together in the end
  * natively
    * instrument interface

* gobject private members
  * we need guidelines for use of ->priv, 
    when make members private, when public
  * we need some convention how to shorten all the
    object->priv->member statements
    * do once object_p=object->priv;
    * #define G_SELF self->priv

* new tests
  * load songs and lookup the parts
    (e.g. bt_machine_get_pattern_by_id)
  * try gtk_main_do_event() in GUI tests
  * add test for trigger params

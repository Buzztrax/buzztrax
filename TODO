run 'make todo' to get a list of todo comments from source

when releasing do:
  * make check
  * cd po;intltool-update -M
  * make dist

* how do we implement multiple voices per machine?
  * simulate
    * source
      * separate instances that are mixed together
    * processors (e.g. multi-tap delay)
      * separate instances that are getting the same input
        and that are mixed together in the end
  * natively
    * instrument interface

* gobject private members
  * we need guidelines for use of ->priv,
    when make members private, when public
  * we need some convention how to shorten all the
    object->priv->member statements
    * do once object_p=object->priv;
    * #define G_SELF self->priv

* new tests
  * load songs and lookup the parts
    (e.g. bt_machine_get_pattern_by_id)
  * try gtk_main_do_event() in GUI tests
  * add test for trigger params

* new stats
  * http://www.chris-lott.org/resources/cmetrics/cyclo-2.0.tar.gz
    mcstrip tools.c | cyclo -c | sort -k2 -n

* quality checks

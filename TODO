* how do we implement multiple voices per machine?
  * source 
    * separate instances that are mixed together
  * processors (e.g. multi-tap delay)
    * separate instances that are getting the same input
      and that are mixed together in the end
* how do we handle global/voice-params
  * gstreamer does not support differentiation between them
  * therefore global_data is 0 for now


* unit-tests
  * in the unit tests package, we have nasty, complex LDADD lines
  * how can we add --g-fatal-warnings when running the unit tests, check
    g_log_set_always_fatal()
    g_log_set_fatal_mask()
  * add unit test that loads songs from the 'tests/songs' folder

* gobject private members
  * we need guidelines for use of ->private, 
    when make members private, when public
  * we need some convention how to shorten all the
    object->private->member statements
    * do once object_p=object->private;

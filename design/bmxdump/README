This was an attempt to write a reader for bmw and bmx files,
the native Jeskola Buzz file formats, in C++.
It dates back to July 2003.

I didn't get very far. I stopped when I realised that the audio
data in bmx files written by buzz 1.2 is compressed in some unknown
format, and I did not have the brains to crack the compression.

Also, the code has been hacked together quite badly, so do not
expect a great design. It has been written as a "sketchpad" and
I originally intended to rewrite it anyway at some stage, but 
never got actually there. It is also not 'pure' C++. Lots of
stuff (eg file I/O, some string handling) is done through the standard
C api. This needs adaption if you care about 100% clean C++ code.

Also note that there is a perl script somewhere at sourceforge
that reads bmxfiles as well. It is far more complete than my
code, but it cannot handle compressed audio data either.

I hand this code on to the buzztard project (http://buzztard.org)
in good will. I hope you guys manage to crack this fscking compression!

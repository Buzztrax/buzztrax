rebuild buzztard.types via
  find $(top_srcdir)/src -name "*.h" -exec grep -oe "bt_.*_get_type" {} \; | sort | uniq
  
using g_object based sub systems
  the XXX_init() function of the subsystem need to be added to SCANOBJ_OPTIONS
  in Makefile.am e.g.: (omit the trailing ';')
  SCANOBJ_OPTIONS=--type-init-func="g_type_init();gst_init(&argc,&argv);gtk_init(&argc,&argv)"

what to document where
  c-language constructs (such as methods, structs, defines, enums, ...)
    inside source-code
  object properties
    extracted from g_param_spec
  signals
		inside source-code
	file long descriptions
		in tmpl/xxx.sgml

files to look into
  <module>-docs.sgml
    defines the overall structure
  <module>-sections.txt
    group symbols to sections
    add sections in alpahbetical order
		for gobject classes,
      put standard gobject entries into <SUBSECTION Standard>
      put private  gobject entries into <SUBSECTION Private>
  templ/*.sgml
    - add extra documentation to sections
		
to make the hierarchy work
	if a documentation file entry (in the section file) is related to an object 
	(e.g. BtSongInfo),
	it needs to be of the same name as the object,
  but all lowercase: BtSongInfo -> btsonginfo.sgml
	and the type of the object must be named "BtSongInfo"
	and not e.g. "BtSongInfoType"

to force rebuilding the docs
  rm docs/reference/bt-*/*.stamp

documentation guidelines
  Whenever a parameter can be NULL, document it. Default is that NULL is not
  acceptable for (pointer) parameters.

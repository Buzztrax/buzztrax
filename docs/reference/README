rebuild buzztard.types via
  find $(top_srcdir)/src -name "*.h" -exec grep -oe "bt_.*_get_type" {} \; | uniq | sort

what to document where
  public methods
    inside object.c
  object properties
    extracted from g_param_spec
  objects

  defines
  
  enums

files to look into
  buzztard-docs.sgml
    defines the overall structure
  buzztard-sections.txt
    group symbols to sections
  templ/*.sgml
    - add extra documentation to sections
	- if file is related to an object (e.g. BtSongInfo),
	  it needs to be of the same name as the object,
      but all lowercase: BtSongInfo -> btsonginfo.sgml
	  and the type of the object must be named "BtSongInfo" and not e.g. "BtSongInfoType"

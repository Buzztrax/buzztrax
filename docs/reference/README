rebuild buzztard.types via
  find $(top_srcdir)/src -name "*.h" -exec grep -oe "bt_.*_get_type" {} \; | uniq | sort

what to document where
  c-language constructs (such as methods, structs, defines, enums, ...)
    inside source-code
  object properties
    extracted from g_param_spec
  signals
		inside source-code
	file long descriptions
		in tmpl/xxx.sgml

files to look into
  buzztard-docs.sgml
    defines the overall structure
  buzztard-sections.txt
    group symbols to sections
  templ/*.sgml
    - add extra documentation to sections
		
to make the hierarchy work
	if a documentation file entry (in the section file) is related to an object 
	(e.g. BtSongInfo),
	it needs to be of the same name as the object,
  but all lowercase: BtSongInfo -> btsonginfo.sgml
	and the type of the object must be named "BtSongInfo"
	and not e.g. "BtSongInfoType"

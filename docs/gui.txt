================================================================================

* mimic the apperance and behaviour of buzz
	- page order : machines, sequence, patterns

* meta-page (blabla)
  - author, title,... form fields + freeform text field
  - save as rdf with dc-schema
  - info can e.g. be used for id-3 tags when encoding

* machine view
	- add grid and snap-to-grid for machines
	- make view zoomable
	- machines
		- machines have level-meters (sources at right side, effects at both sides,
			sinks at the left side)

* sequence view
  - allow folding for each label until the next label
	- colorize track-columns like machines (generator, effect, player/analyser)

* pattern view
	- allow folding tracks
  - views
	  - number view (like buzz)
    - gui view (have embedded sliders, drop-downs and check-boxes)

* menu
	- menu/new load/default song, which could contain e.g.
		- initial blabla page
		- some initial machines
		? does it make sense to provide "new from..."
*

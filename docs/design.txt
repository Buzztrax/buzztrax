** recording
own jack-driver wav-record
when telling buzztard to record wav-out instead of playing it, we attach a new
wav-record driver to jack and supplying filename and jack-driver name. Then we
diconnect our wave-out from the current playback driver and connect it to the
newly created wav-record driver and start playback. The driver will then start
recording and stop, when the clients have benn detached again.
Recording will be done as fast as possible, as the jack-driver will have
0-waits.
QUESTION: can we attach drivers to running jackd?
